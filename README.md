# Student Record System

This is a command-line implementation of a simple Student Record System. It is based on chapter 14 of the 2005 book '*Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts to Code*' by Jacquie Barber.

In this repository, I re-write the orginal Java 1.5 implementation in Java 8 and also implement the command-line Dart 2.8 equivalent application. 

Please note that:

- I am learning Dart and this project was one of the simple project I thought about to get me started. There may be some flaws/bugs/mistakes in the Dart implementation and since I am learning Dart (at this point), it may not follow Dart style guidelines in its entirety.
- The codes were written for my entertainment and learning only.
